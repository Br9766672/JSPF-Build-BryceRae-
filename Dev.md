Element 5 is made up of two different babylon scenes. A light world and a dark world.
## Light World
In the light world the scene contains a player mesh with animations that a play can use to move around the beach themed scene.
the palm trees are sprites that are randomly placed along the sand textured ground to make it look like your on a tropical island.
